# Server Build

By default every Windows virtual machine that you deploy in Azure from the marketplace will be deployed using US regional settings. So the timezone, time format, currency, keyboard will all be in EN-US.
I got a few requests lately from customers and others if it would be possible to automate the regional settings configuration.  This blogpost will cover how to  create an XML settings file that contains all of our regional settings and how to apply those regional settings to our Virtual Machines in Azure.
